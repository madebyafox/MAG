Therefore, I selected one generation above mine. I expect that women during this generation had fewer opportunities to interact with this type of triple-form paperwork and must therefore be more likely a male creator.

But GenerationX seems familiar and capable enough that the task could have been completed without a problem even with minimal familiarity with Microsoft Excel.

Maybe the blue coloring has some kind of subconscious impact on this belief as well.

These are what I assume the icons intend to represent for each graph section. The topic is not interesting and I feel the information could also be quite dated. If 1980 was omitted because data was not available for the year, then what the hell good is knowing about the productivity levels of an era long before I was alive going to do for me.

I included some commentary inside of my answers, but I marked it as such to not get confused with the actual answers.  (a) There were several graphs that I thought could have been the work of more than one individual. In these cases, I answered based on who I expected was acting in the supervisory capacity. It became too difficult to imagine specific gender roles for employees who may have been delegated the specific task of creating the graph. I believe that the gender question should probably have been excluded when the answer was for a corporation. Similarly, the age question had similar difficulties because this type of task could easily be delegated to an intern. But it would not be very likely that the intern could/would be credited with the creation.  (b) It was not clear about the  range between Professional and Layperson. I understand professional to be a distinction of whether an individual is paid for a task and not necessarily an indication of quality. I have known several hobby enthusiasts that I feel are of higher quality than their professional counterparts, but I did not know if Amateur/Hobbyist should be considered the halfway between professional and layperson. Because I would consider an amateur as the opposite of professional in that one gets paid and one does not. Perhaps expert would have been a better term if the intent was trained vs untrained.   (c) The time estimation seemed unrealistic for the number of questions and the level of detail requested for each response. Given my typing speed, I would estimate that I spent 20-25 minutes in typing. This does not factor in the time spent thinking and reflecting on the images. I would recommend a 45 minute estimation if you run this task in the future. It is entirely possible that I have a different understanding of the amount of detail that was requested. In that case, I would recommend using phrasing to indicate a  preference towards a medium amount of detail rather than as much detail as the user can provide.
