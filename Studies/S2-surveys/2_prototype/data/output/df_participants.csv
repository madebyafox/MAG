But I do not think the individual is a seasoned designer. It does look like the individual has some sort of design background as it would some design skills to cut out individual leaves, arrange them in equal-width bars, and create an easy to read bar graph with typographic heirarchy.   My first guess at gender is Female, because of pink. An unfortunate stereotype but that is where my mind went to.   To have the patience to arrange all the leaves in this order, I imagine this person as someone who is detail oriented and similar to how I work as a designer. Therefore I could expect them to share my views and be someone who is competent and trustworthy enough to give a set of data and ask for a bargraphh.","401.056","design_advanced","80","I think it could be either Canva or Photoshop.

Which makes me lean towards trusting it. Other than that, it's not visually pleasing. It's quite ugly. The leaves making up the bars is unecessary...especially since it seems like each bar does not represent one kind of leaf.   The designer spent way too much time cutting out all the leaves and didn't even fully cut them all out as there is still white background appearing in a lot off the leaf images.   It appears like the creator of the graph wanted to do a leaf themed bar graph. They all seem arbritrarily placed. I think the the bars could have just been basic shapes. The leaf theme could have been in secondary design elements. Perhaps a leaf border or just accent elements.   The font choice could have been more intentional as it looks like the designer opted for a default choice.","bar chart/bar graph","404.799","4","engage","business","tech company","58","millenial","54","Male","56","23","55","32","54","45","64","57","The biggest thing that leads me to believe a designer designed this is the use of color.

It's really hard to answer these questions based on this image because you can't really tell much about who designed this other than they are a competent designer who understands how to design with data. It does a good job at informing. It also does a good job at being boring. There's no extra fluff.

Because I believe this is an anti-gun infographic, I suspect it is a left-wing backed image.

Just based on intuition and imagination, I imaged a 30 something year old man creating this graph for his job. I don't think you have to be an expert in graphic design to create this because its graphics are relatively simple, but I think you have to at least be decent in data analysis because this type of graph isn't that common/simple.

I feel like graphs that show so many trends in time present so much data that they're trying to inform, but I also think showing trends is a way to persuade someone of a change, and again, the flag background makes me think they're trying to make the audience feel a particular way.","Line graph?","232.72","2","engage","news","Probably a left wing one, like NYT","80","millenial","40","Male","60","80","40","20","40","50","60","50","When I saw this image, the first thing I thought of was an image showing the dangers/harmful effects of guns (the blue icons look like guns to me), and I imagined a man working for the NYT creating it.

You don't have to be a graphic design expert to make this, but I think you have to be relatively good at statistics to accurately depict increases and decreases and know how to represent amounts with icons.

The colors also seem to be chosen to play on peoples' fears (the yellow to dark red to black color scheme is very reminiscent of bombs and blood and violence).

I included some commentary inside of my answers, but I marked it as such to not get confused with the actual answers.  (a) There were several graphs that I thought could have been the work of more than one individual. In these cases, I answered based on who I expected was acting in the supervisory capacity. It became too difficult to imagine specific gender roles for employees who may have been delegated the specific task of creating the graph. I believe that the gender question should probably have been excluded when the answer was for a corporation. Similarly, the age question had similar difficulties because this type of task could easily be delegated to an intern. But it would not be very likely that the intern could/would be credited with the creation.  (b) It was not clear about the  range between Professional and Layperson. I understand professional to be a distinction of whether an individual is paid for a task and not necessarily an indication of quality. I have known several hobby enthusiasts that I feel are of higher quality than their professional counterparts, but I did not know if Amateur/Hobbyist should be considered the halfway between professional and layperson. Because I would consider an amateur as the opposite of professional in that one gets paid and one does not. Perhaps expert would have been a better term if the intent was trained vs untrained.   (c) The time estimation seemed unrealistic for the number of questions and the level of detail requested for each response. Given my typing speed, I would estimate that I spent 20-25 minutes in typing. This does not factor in the time spent thinking and reflecting on the images. I would recommend a 45 minute estimation if you run this task in the future. It is entirely possible that I have a different understanding of the amount of detail that was requested. In that case, I would recommend using phrasing to indicate a  preference towards a medium amount of detail rather than as much detail as the user can provide.","engage","organization","Something related to plants, maybe something entertainment with an secondary educational purpose, like Bill Nye The Science Guy, but more modern.","55","gen-x","65","Male","70","40","75","45","60","50","60","65","The pink background reminds me of the shade that comes with the paperwork that bleeds through from the top copy onto a pink and a yellow copy underneath. It has been many years since I have seen this format, but I remember them vividly because I had to use them in my very first job. I cannot think of any other reason to use this shade of pink other than some kind of mental association with the color and an official form, so I suspect that the creator is old enough to have enough experience with filling out these forms. Therefore, I selected one generation above mine. I expect that women during this generation had fewer opportunities to interact with this type of triple-form paperwork and must therefore be more likely a male creator. I do not have a clue what the graph is trying to show, and so I default back to my basic assumptions about the larger U.S. population for determining the probability the author is a liberal. I expect that liberals of that generation are generally less confrontational. I also expect that an older liberal is less progressive than their younger counterparts and likely shares some to many of my same values. I assume we agree on a lot of the basics. I generally find people trustworthy and I have no reason to believe this was not created by a person. I am aware this graph withheld a source attribution, but I do not want to unfairly hold that against the author without confirmation it was done purposely. I expect that no self-respecting professional data analyst is going to create something with this little of detail. I do believe that the creator has some minimal professional experience, but not as a primary duty, with image editing software (e.g., Photoshop) because it looks better than what I could have done in my high school multimedia class.","981.136","design_basic","65","What little experience I have with basic applications, like Canva, have made me aware that they offer a large variety of media content to import into the workarea. I believe that enough time has passed since I used one last that it is reasonable to believe that they now offer the ability to stretch an image to increase the length, but to fill in the gaps with generated sections of image rather than stretching the image. The lack of background removal in the first two images and to a lesser degree in subsequent images leads me to believe that a non-professional created this image and therefore is more likely to use a non-professional application. It also seems that the plant design changes in later sections and this reinforces my idea that the selections came from a provided collection of plant images. A large enough collection that the sizes could be relatively closely matched and then modified with the previously mentioned method. But not so large or of high quality as to be mistaken for a professional clip collection. I also expect that the organization does not have a large disposable budget for this sort of task.

I would look just to make sure that I am seeing what I thought I saw, but there is not really any motivation to continue looking.   I do not believe that I would be interested enough to read the post that came with the graph, so it is not likely that I would give myself an opportunity to justify taking any particular action against the posting account.

It does not seem likely that a Boomer in the publishing business would have had to make their own graphs as opposed to sending the task request to an assistant. But GenerationX seems familiar and capable enough that the task could have been completed without a problem even with minimal familiarity with Microsoft Excel. It is possible that I remember seeing male names more often than female names as authors of textbooks in my educational years, leading to a perception that the image was more likely created by a male. Maybe the blue coloring has some kind of subconscious impact on this belief as well. I do not believe that it does, but my mind seems aware of the whole blue=boy, pink=female associations, so I wanted to mention it because it does seem relevant given the gender question and I cannot honestly eliminate it as a source of inference, but it does not seem likely.   (*) I expect that this was created as part of a paid job and was therefore done for selfish reasons. But I do not expect that the individual would have gotten into this line of work without some desire to help educate others. So it is not entirely for selfish reasons.   (*) I believe the creator possibly leaned right due to the age and gender. I assume that older males tend to lean right.   (*) I tend to trust what I find in textbooks and so I must also find the authors and creators of the content as somewhat trustworthy. I understand that the publication process eliminates the potential for malicious content, but I also must assume that a textbook publication has the ability to hire reputable authors. I am not without doubt that the individual might have personal issues that could influence their judgement, but it seems reasonable to assume they are moderately reasonable.","932.571","viz_basic","90","Based on my belief that this image was created around 2010, Microsoft Office (Excel) seems like the most reasonable software option. Data visualization software was not yet mainstream and programming was still in its twilight years of not-yet-mainstream. Excel seems the best candidate because of availability. The application can create this graph without much more than a beginner level of familiarity and it was widely available in ~2010.","60","75","40","65","The graph feels very unimportant because of the age. In most topics, there is very little that I can see as relevant to my current day-to-day life that could be influenced by additional knowledge of the happenings of 2004-2009. I will admit that I would likely seek out more information if somehow the graph title could convince me of its relevance, but it seems far more likely that I would have no interest because the topic does not relate to me or because the information is too outdated to have current relevance on a topic I am interested in. This answer might be influenced by my interests in information technologies. At the rate technology has advanced in the last half a century, two decades back is like looking into the stone age. And this perception sometimes influences my perception of time in other areas.","line chart","353.432",,"engage","business","Any business that has had reason to publish a marketing document. My perception here is pretty broad. But to be honest, this is simple enough to come from anyone.","60","millenial","55","Male","55","55","45","45","70","100","60","60","I feel that I am doing something wrong here. The number of questions, each requesting as great of detail as possible, has resulted in a time that far exceeds the 30 minute estimation. I do not want to modify my approach to the questions half way through, but this effort requirement is approaching the ridiculous level. As to the question, I have no idea. It looks like something I might have seen in an advertisement at some point in the past. I do not know if the re-use of coloring is purposeful or the result of an inexperienced creator. I do not know if the gaps are purposeful or if someone decided to use white as one of the colors. I am more confident that it was not the result of poor craftsmanship.   (*) My answers are primarily formed from the impression that this was created by some kind corporate entity. Possibly copied from a brochure and posted onto a social media feed. It is my belief that there are more men employed by corporations in supervisory or management positions in the marketing departments. Therefore, the graph was either created by a male or at the direction of a male to a larger probability than by a female or at the direction of a female.   (*) I do not think much of this profession and I do not think much of those who are employed as such.  Assuming this is a male, I view him as a male with less than desirable personality traits. But not to the point of absurdity.   (*) Assuming that this organization has some kind of internet presence (implied through the decision to publish this document online, as inferred by my past experiences of seeing similar graphs through online brochures), I am also to assume that there is a Democratic leaning among the employees and therefore a liberal leaning of the individual. I have no reason to believe this bends the scale too highly.   (*) I have no reason to believe that this graph was created for purposes other than satisfying the role demands of the job which the creator is employed as and is therefore entirely selfish in the pursuit of avoiding the failure to complete his employment requirements.","1030.951","viz_basic","55","Microsoft Excel because it is more widely available than the other options. I have no reason to believe the other options could not create this type of graph, but it seems restricting to choose a more specific option.","49","55","55","51","Again, my answer is entirely dependent on the topic of the graph. If the information that is represented in the graph is something that I can benefit from knowing more about, or if I have a feeling towards disputing the representation, then I would first look up to verify the graphical representation is an accurate depiction of the figures. If the data does not spark my interest then I would continue scrolling. This question honestly feels far too trivial without knowing what the data represents. I cannot imagine that someone can honestly form an opinion about the actions they predict taking in response to seeing a graph without knowing what the graph is about. I see a lot of topics in my feed and the range of type and quality of the graphs is just as large. I cannot think of a scenario where I would choose an action based on the general representation of data without concern to the topic. Even if I thought the graph was intentionally fraudulent, there are some topics where that seems expected and not surprising.","comparative bar chart","496.4",,"engage","individual","data hobbyist","75","millenial","85","Female","60","60","45","45","55","49","65","65","The color scheme is what mostly influences my belief this creator came from the millennial generation. I have noticed that my peers have seemingly shoved their heads so far up their rear ends such that they have seemingly accepted pain-in-the-butt color schemes as intelligent choices. I see a lot of grey text on slightly lighter grey backgrounds in blogs from respectable authors of a similar age. In this case, it is a light brown text on a tan background. It seems that my generation, for all of their intent to assist those less accessible, have discarded the concepts of a minimally appropriate contrast.   For gender, I have an inherent perception that a lot of the data people from my generation are either women or gays. I am not convinced that this is necessarily a professional data analyst, but at the very least it is likely someone either studying the data sciences or an individual that follows the practice in their spare time. The chart does not look randomly produced and must have been generated from a data source. Most likely via some form of automation through an API feed. This reinforces my perceptions of age because I do not expect that level of digital comfort from older hobbyists.   I do not really see any kind of political bias because the east coast and upper west coast is largely ignored. I fell back to my default understanding of U.S. population as being slightly Democratic leaning and therefore slightly more likely as liberal. I refer back to my previous statements.   I have no idea if this author had a specific purpose in mind with creating the chart, but I felt it was at least partially for selfish reasons in that it was done furthering their own enjoyment of messing around with data. This might have been an experiment to try out a new script or maybe it was based on data from a topic that was of personal interest. But I do not believe it was done in pursuit of the greater good because it seems to go father than the bare essentials.","1190.089","programming","60","node.js with D3. My belief in D3 as the library is because that is the only mapping library that I know of for javascript. My confidence in javascript is mainly because I am not familiar enough with R to know what graph creation abilities are available. I understand it is very handy with textual data, but I am without a reference for its media ability. With javascript, I am aware that it is capable of all the necessary functions to pull, manipulate/clean and then graph. I expect that d3 is a popular enough library that it would not be too difficult to find a template to produce this graph. The data points seem split up in small hexagons and that format seems vaguely familiar. So I expect that the design has been popularized as a graph display option. I believe that more sophisticated options like Tableau are just a candy shell for completing tasks that can be programmatically accomplished. I am also not aware about the option for free personal use of PowerBI and Tableau, so I am not confident that it would be the first choice for a non-student hobbyist. This leaves me with programming language as the best candidate.","30","30","50","50","I feel that my choices above are accurate in cases that are limited by the importance of the graph topic. I would look up more information if I felt the topic was important and could impact my life in some way. The data points indicate a lack of presence in my current location, but close enough that it might soon spread to my location. This could be health, weather or really any objectively important topic. I would have no reason to look up the data sources or give this any more attention if the topic were a map of locations that searched for naked pokomon on PornHub or concentrations of Justin Bieber album sales.","heatmap","351.584",,"scroll","political","RAND, The Heritage Foundation or something in that line of work.","60","boomer","55","Male","51","40","49","55","45","100","65","51","This is really starting to feel trivial because I have no idea who creates this stuff. Even if I had an idea, I do not know if the same person who is making the graph is also coming up with the data. The question asks about backgrounds in both data analytics and graphic design and that makes me less confident. In cases where I expect a team effort, it seems nonsensical to narrow the group down to a single gender or a single age. Then I have to factor in the possible of interns and the whole process just becomes a mess to single out a single selection. And this task has now entered the ridiculous level of required effort. I am confident that I am approaching the 1,500 word mark.   (*) For these reasons I have no confident of any value that my selections for the age range or gender of the creator are accurate. I have made my best guess and so I feel confident insofar as I am more confident than the other answer options that my selected ones are correct. But I do not feel confident in the overall accuracy much more than I would rate the outcome of a coin flip.   (*) The image vaguely resembles something I remember seeing in a magazine at some point in my life. I believe this could imply that the individual who came up with this idea is old enough to come from the generation of individuals who worked in the magazine business during the time I grew up. This graph does not seem to represent anything I relate to modern stylings.   (*) Given the age, I am more likely to believe that the individual was male. I do not necessarily believe that this graph was more likely made by a male, but I am more confident in the age estimation of the individual and I am more confident than not that males were more representative of the workforce during the era that I vaguely remember seeing this type of graph in. And so I infer that it is possible that an employee in the magazine business, if employed at an early age, could have made his way into working for a think-tank such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation in his later years and either created or had this graph created at his direction.   (*) I believe this graph was created to satisfy a requirement from his employer and is therefore entirely for selfish reasons rather than selfless.   (*) I have no reason to distrust an organization without knowing more specifically about their past. I expect that a company, such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation, has had some amount of scrutiny in the past. And if they were going to lie, it would not be in such an obvious and direct manner. So I feel somewhat confident in trusting the graph as a fair representation of the graph. I am not entirely convinced that the specific choice of areas to represent are necessarily those that should be suitable for direct comparison. I also do not understand why the sizes are not uniform across the graph sections. The difference in size of 75-79 does not seem the same as 65-70 for the individual section. This might imply that the graph was created without data available for the year 1980 or that it has reasons to hide 1980 from the representation. In either case, it is unusual, but not necessarily untrustworthy at face value.","1187.3","?","100","I am not of the belief that this graph was created digitally and so I did not see an answer that reflected whatever methods would be used in a magazine publication from maybe 1980 or maybe the 1990s or maybe present day.","35","65","70","35","I do not have an interest in comparing individuals with U.S. with Gross National Product.

This looks like something that could be to show a statistic about nature or plants, in a calming way. This does not appear threatening or insulting.

I think it could be made easily with simple software and doesn't require a whole lot of thought.

With the flags and the colors, and even the alignment of the headings and comments, this looks like something meant to incite conversation.","80.498","viz_advanced","47","Again, I'm not sure on which tools can be used for this, but this looks like it could have been done from a more complex software. However, the data points aren't TOO complex, so it could just be Excel prettied up a bit with graphics.","34","35","79","37","This feels negative and inflammatory.

It looks like it's talking about a country and maybe the bloodshed involved in some topic? My best bet would be negative practices going on in a country, and the effects of that. This is probably meant to bring attention to a larger horrible topic that others don't know about, but in a frightening graphic.","110.105","design_advanced","74","Not sure, but this would need to be something complex.

Furthermore, a left-wing, environmental activist strikes me as someone younger in age. Because the graph looked like it contains data (likely from a study) and was made by someone with at least SOME graphic design experience, I was led to believe that although the  person who created this is likely young, they are likely not Gen-Z age. I answered the final two questions (whether this person shares my values and whether this person is trustworthy), with a bit of doubt about whether my presumption about what this graph is depicting is correct. Because I am not 100% confident about what this graph is actually meant to depict nor have I been given the source, I cannot say with 100% certainty that this person shares my values nor that they are completely trustworthy.

Furthermore, since this is not the most aesthetically pleasing graph, I also found myself assuming that this was not created by someone with a grasp on graphic design; hence my answer there. The lack of attention to aesthetic leads me to believe that this was created by a man, too. The detail in the data makes me more likely to trust the information being displayed, but I was not at all sure whether I shared values with this person.

As a left-wing woman, if my hunch is correct, I do not share values with this creator. Because I assume the creator is right-wing, I am inclined to believe that they are an older male (based on my own experiences). From my own biases, I am not likely to trust such information either.

The geographic map in the bottom right corner leads me to that assumption. For example, the map could be depicting the COVID-19 vaccinations of different neighboring regions. Furthermore, going off of that train of thought, the upside down bar graph may indicate the mortality rate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of what specific information this infographic is depicting, it is clearly statistics-based. This leads me to believe that a researcher collected this data and created this infographic. That means that the creator cannot be too young (Gen-Z age) nor can they be too old (retired), since most researchers are of working-age with a few years (at least) of higher-education under their belt. Although I cannot determine whether I believe this person to share my values since I am not sure what specific data they have collected, I do believe that this level of sophistication (the appearance of the graph, the inclusion of a variety of data) indicates that this person put in the time and effort to accurately reflect their findings (i.e., I can more easily trust this infographic). Because this infographic seems to be educational, I was also under the impression that the creator was likely altruistic, as those who seek the truth and attempt to educate others with such information are altruistic in their own right. The sophistication of the graph and the clear detail of the data displayed indicate to me that this creator is well-versed in data analysis and graphic design. Gender is the hardest part for me to ascertain here.

I also may second guess reposting this for the sole reason that it may be overwhelming to viewers.

That led me to believe it could be political in nature, though it could have more to do with science and education, which the doodles lead me to believe.
