In terms of difficulty, it doesn't seem like that hard of a chart to make. It is likely pushing some sort of message about healthy eating or veganism or something along those lines. Something environmental related. The color choices remind me of something I would see on Buzzfeed. Overall it presents very feminine, though I can't really pinpoint why, maybe the pink.","I originally thought this was made by a good-health store or something along those lines, but the message now seems to be coming from maybe a charity, someone who's focused on improving the lives of lower-income individuals. I still maintain that this was made by a female millennial, because this is a topic that millenials seem more interested in and women are more likely to focus on charitable things like this. The chart itself is the same, so difficulty and appeal haven't changed. I would say this is more left wing than I thought, as low-income areas are a major focus of left-wing economic policy, and the mental health (which trees correspond to) of low-income individuals is left-wing social policy. I originally thought this was supposed to be persuasive, but now it seems like it's trying to inform the viewer of the conditions that low-income individuals live in.","F"

It reminds me of something I would expect to see in a business meeting full of old men. It seems like it's conveying something about the metrics of a business over time, maybe stock prices or costs, or something along those lines. It would be incredibly easy to make, so the difficulty is not high. The appeal is very low, as it's generic and boring. Right-wing people are more likely to be in higher positions in businesses, so that's why I attributed that there.","Yeah I was way off on this one. This seems like something I would see in a left-wing newspaper, given that it's about alternative fuel sources, a primarily left-wing topic. Once again, I chose female because women are more likely to be left-wing. Mainly the same reasons as the previous example, millennials are more likely to care about issues such as this. Older people tend to be more on the side of oil and coal.  Rather than inform, I think this is trying to persuade by showing that most people are on the side of alternative sources, so the viewer should reconsider their opinion if they prefer coal.","B"

I'd immediately think this is the change in pollution or trash in countries perhaps, given that the background is the United States flag looking dirty/burnt. As with the previous questions, I expect the creator to be young/middle-aged, so millennial to Gen X. Women are more likely to care about environmental issues. Aesthetically, this is a step up, it's very interesting in terms of color choices and the background. It's giving volcano, which may or may not support whatever the details are, I don't know yet.","I was somewhat close this time. I definitely got the left-wing vibe from it. I lowered my trustworthy score a lot because it says ""according to corrupt.af"" which does not sound like a very credible site. I also lowered the age down to millennial purely because of the usage of 'af', which I don't imagine older people using often. Rather than inform, this is to persuade people that Trump is corrupt. The chart itself, again, stays the same, so aesthetically I like it and the difficulty stays the same.","C"

The person might be a botanist. Normally, statistical data are presented with bar charts, pie chart, etc but this person cropped pictures of plants to represent bars on the chart. I guess this person is a millennial, because millennials are playful and like trying out new things. However, the chosen color and text fonts doesn't look professional.","Yes, I will pause to take a look at the image. However I can't trust the authenticity of the data because it looks misleading. Since the chart is showing the Average number of trees(not types) by neighborhood income, a single picture (bar) should have been used to depict the number of trees.","F"
