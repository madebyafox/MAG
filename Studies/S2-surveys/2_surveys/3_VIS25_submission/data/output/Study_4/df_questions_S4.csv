In terms of difficulty, it doesn't seem like that hard of a chart to make. It is likely pushing some sort of message about healthy eating or veganism or something along those lines. Something environmental related. The color choices remind me of something I would see on Buzzfeed. Overall it presents very feminine, though I can't really pinpoint why, maybe the pink.","I originally thought this was made by a good-health store or something along those lines, but the message now seems to be coming from maybe a charity, someone who's focused on improving the lives of lower-income individuals. I still maintain that this was made by a female millennial, because this is a topic that millenials seem more interested in and women are more likely to focus on charitable things like this. The chart itself is the same, so difficulty and appeal haven't changed. I would say this is more left wing than I thought, as low-income areas are a major focus of left-wing economic policy, and the mental health (which trees correspond to) of low-income individuals is left-wing social policy. I originally thought this was supposed to be persuasive, but now it seems like it's trying to inform the viewer of the conditions that low-income individuals live in.","F"

It reminds me of something I would expect to see in a business meeting full of old men. It seems like it's conveying something about the metrics of a business over time, maybe stock prices or costs, or something along those lines. It would be incredibly easy to make, so the difficulty is not high. The appeal is very low, as it's generic and boring. Right-wing people are more likely to be in higher positions in businesses, so that's why I attributed that there.","Yeah I was way off on this one. This seems like something I would see in a left-wing newspaper, given that it's about alternative fuel sources, a primarily left-wing topic. Once again, I chose female because women are more likely to be left-wing. Mainly the same reasons as the previous example, millennials are more likely to care about issues such as this. Older people tend to be more on the side of oil and coal.  Rather than inform, I think this is trying to persuade by showing that most people are on the side of alternative sources, so the viewer should reconsider their opinion if they prefer coal.","B"
