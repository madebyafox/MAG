The leaf theme could have been in secondary design elements. Perhaps a leaf border or just accent elements.

It has been many years since I have seen this format, but I remember them vividly because I had to use them in my very first job.

The lack of background removal in the first two images and to a lesser degree in subsequent images leads me to believe that a non-professional created this image and therefore is more likely to use a non-professional application.

It is possible that I remember seeing male names more often than female names as authors of textbooks in my educational years, leading to a perception that the image was more likely created by a male. Maybe the blue coloring has some kind of subconscious impact on this belief as well. I do not believe that it does, but my mind seems aware of the whole blue=boy, pink=female associations, so I wanted to mention it because it does seem relevant given the gender question and I cannot honestly eliminate it as a source of inference, but it does not seem likely.   (*) I expect that this was created as part of a paid job and was therefore done for selfish reasons. But I do not expect that the individual would have gotten into this line of work without some desire to help educate others. So it is not entirely for selfish reasons.   (*) I believe the creator possibly leaned right due to the age and gender. I assume that older males tend to lean right.   (*) I tend to trust what I find in textbooks and so I must also find the authors and creators of the content as somewhat trustworthy. I understand that the publication process eliminates the potential for malicious content, but I also must assume that a textbook publication has the ability to hire reputable authors. I am not without doubt that the individual might have personal issues that could influence their judgement, but it seems reasonable to assume they are moderately reasonable.",15.54,"viz_basic",90,"Based on my belief that this image was created around 2010, Microsoft Office (Excel) seems like the most reasonable software option. Data visualization software was not yet mainstream and programming was still in its twilight years of not-yet-mainstream. Excel seems the best candidate because of availability. The application can create this graph without much more than a beginner level of familiarity and it was widely available in ~2010.",60,75,40,65,"The graph feels very unimportant because of the age. In most topics, there is very little that I can see as relevant to my current day-to-day life that could be influenced by additional knowledge of the happenings of 2004-2009. I will admit that I would likely seek out more information if somehow the graph title could convince me of its relevance, but it seems far more likely that I would have no interest because the topic does not relate to me or because the information is too outdated to have current relevance on a topic I am interested in. This answer might be influenced by my interests in information technologies. At the rate technology has advanced in the last half a century, two decades back is like looking into the stone age. And this perception sometimes influences my perception of time in other areas.","line chart",5.89,,"NOTHING — just keep scrolling"

It looks like something I might have seen in an advertisement at some point in the past. I do not know if the re-use of coloring is purposeful or the result of an inexperienced creator. I do not know if the gaps are purposeful or if someone decided to use white as one of the colors. I am more confident that it was not the result of poor craftsmanship.   (*) My answers are primarily formed from the impression that this was created by some kind corporate entity. Possibly copied from a brochure and posted onto a social media feed. It is my belief that there are more men employed by corporations in supervisory or management positions in the marketing departments. Therefore, the graph was either created by a male or at the direction of a male to a larger probability than by a female or at the direction of a female.

With javascript, I am aware that it is capable of all the necessary functions to pull, manipulate/clean and then graph. I expect that d3 is a popular enough library that it would not be too difficult to find a template to produce this graph. The data points seem split up in small hexagons and that format seems vaguely familiar. So I expect that the design has been popularized as a graph display option.

Even if I had an idea, I do not know if the same person who is making the graph is also coming up with the data. The question asks about backgrounds in both data analytics and graphic design and that makes me less confident. In cases where I expect a team effort, it seems nonsensical to narrow the group down to a single gender or a single age. Then I have to factor in the possible of interns and the whole process just becomes a mess to single out a single selection. And this task has now entered the ridiculous level of required effort. I am confident that I am approaching the 1,500 word mark.   (*) For these reasons I have no confident of any value that my selections for the age range or gender of the creator are accurate. I have made my best guess and so I feel confident insofar as I am more confident than the other answer options that my selected ones are correct. But I do not feel confident in the overall accuracy much more than I would rate the outcome of a coin flip.   (*) The image vaguely resembles something I remember seeing in a magazine at some point in my life. I believe this could imply that the individual who came up with this idea is old enough to come from the generation of individuals who worked in the magazine business during the time I grew up. This graph does not seem to represent anything I relate to modern stylings.   (*) Given the age, I am more likely to believe that the individual was male. I do not necessarily believe that this graph was more likely made by a male, but I am more confident in the age estimation of the individual and I am more confident than not that males were more representative of the workforce during the era that I vaguely remember seeing this type of graph in. And so I infer that it is possible that an employee in the magazine business, if employed at an early age, could have made his way into working for a think-tank such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation in his later years and either created or had this graph created at his direction.   (*) I believe this graph was created to satisfy a requirement from his employer and is therefore entirely for selfish reasons rather than selfless.   (*) I have no reason to distrust an organization without knowing more specifically about their past. I expect that a company, such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation, has had some amount of scrutiny in the past. And if they were going to lie, it would not be in such an obvious and direct manner. So I feel somewhat confident in trusting the graph as a fair representation of the graph. I am not entirely convinced that the specific choice of areas to represent are necessarily those that should be suitable for direct comparison. I also do not understand why the sizes are not uniform across the graph sections. The difference in size of 75-79 does not seem the same as 65-70 for the individual section.

The geographic map in the bottom right corner leads me to that assumption. For example, the map could be depicting the COVID-19 vaccinations of different neighboring regions. Furthermore, going off of that train of thought, the upside down bar graph may indicate the mortality rate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of what specific information this infographic is depicting, it is clearly statistics-based. This leads me to believe that a researcher collected this data and created this infographic. That means that the creator cannot be too young (Gen-Z age) nor can they be too old (retired), since most researchers are of working-age with a few years (at least) of higher-education under their belt. Although I cannot determine whether I believe this person to share my values since I am not sure what specific data they have collected, I do believe that this level of sophistication (the appearance of the graph, the inclusion of a variety of data) indicates that this person put in the time and effort to accurately reflect their findings (i.e., I can more easily trust this infographic). Because this infographic seems to be educational, I was also under the impression that the creator was likely altruistic, as those who seek the truth and attempt to educate others with such information are altruistic in their own right. The sophistication of the graph and the clear detail of the data displayed indicate to me that this creator is well-versed in data analysis and graphic design.
