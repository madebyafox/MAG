Millenial, 80% confident: it feels a bit ""hip"" for most Gen X people, much less boomers, and using blatant stereotyping, I wouldn't expect Gen Z to make graphs. I am a member of Gen Z. I make graphs. I think also the pink is close enough to ""Millenial"" pink and the aesthetic seems slightly dated, like it was made by someone in her early 30's who buys t-shirts that might not say ""Girl Boss"" but do have bad puns on them?  Female, 90% confident: It's pink and green and has flowers on it. I don't like that this seems overtly feminine as a graph, but it does.  Layperson, 60%: it has Canva vibes. I know some graphic designers who would make it but I would expect a more interesting font (not louder, but less boilerplate) if it were done professionally, and clearer lines at the top of the graph. Also, red-green colorblindness exists. Professional in data analysis, 3%: The lines at the top of the graph aren't clear. What self respecting data professional would do that? Also, again: colorblindness. Left wing, 25%: it feels more democrat because of the florals and because it feels like a graph about ecology or feminine issues, but I can easily imagine conservative women making something like this too. I'm taking the slider for this question more as ""slightly left"" than ""there's no chance this feels right."" Diplomatic, 88%: the only things that evoke violence in this graph are the red background (yes, I know it's peach, I also know color theory due to my unfortunate social media habits and also. job.) and the lines being unclear. It feels like a friendly pretty image, not something accusatory or controversial.  Does share my values, 75%: I'm a liberal and this feels slightly left and I like beauty (and red/green color combinations!), but also I value accessibility and clear lines on graphs, so we could get a coffee together but we wouldn't be friends Trustworthy, 65%: I think this is at least slightly sexist of me? But also: I'm sure there could be similarly pretty data presentation THAT WAS CLEARLY AT ONE PART OF THE LINE AND NOT AT ANGLES. I guess it could be a fun way of indicating confidence intervals but a) that's not said anywhere and b) the lines aren't at a consistent angle. I would look at this, think ""huh, that's cool,"" and only click on the link or Google it if something in the graph seriously challenged my perceptions or if the discourse around it make extremely strong claims. It doesn't convince me of anything and it doesn't seem serious enough to stick in my head. (Again with the sexism.

In reality I know that weird distances between bars are not necessarily indicative of horrific moral character, but the way this increases from 10's to 1000's is offensive. My mom recently made a geometry test with a question that used both feet and inches, and this is the graph equivalent of that problem, except worse, because I am not in a graphs class and I want to get information from the information visualizations that I see. Gender: It feels more ""professional"" than previous graphs and it is a bit ugly, two things my initial reaction to an image associates with men. This is gross, and yet. Professional in graphic design: I assume whoever made this was employed to make it, but I hope they were doing a job they were unqualified for, rather than a job that they were qualified for. Why is the center line so shaky. Why three different shades of red and two different shades of grey.  Professional in data analysis: I just hope that a professional would have some sense of integrity and interest in making graphs that are readable instead of graphs that are bad. Right wing: I'm being partisan by hoping someone on my side wouldn't make something so terrible. Also deeper red = more Republican/crime/violence vibes. Confrontational: I hope they're confrontational because I want to fight them. Also this seems like it was made to make stupid arguments. Selfish: UNINTERESTED IN MAKING READABLE GRAPHS. GIVES ME AN ACT SCIENCE QUESTION. AND FOR WHAT??  Does not share my values: I like things that are good instead of things that are bad. As do we all, even though where we draw those lines differs greatly. As I and the creator of this graph--I hope--differ greatly. Untrustworthy: space your numbers evenly. Pick a scale.

"62","R_8GBUP7EppZryxHP","B0-0","MAKER_EXPLAIN","There are a few reasons why I think the image creator was a layperson in graphic design. The first is that the bars are not 'cleanly' shaped or consistently colored. The first bars in the 'pressed leaf' design have white behind them while the later bars have darker fronds that don't have any white behind them, and while a case could be made that that's part of what the graph is representing (some sort of leaf density?), it's not as consistent or nice looking as a professional graphic designer would make it look. Secondly, the background is a soft, very red-toned pink, and the bars are green, mostly. While red and green are complementary colors, these specific shades do not contrast particularly well (especially when I have the brightness all the way down as I usually do), and red-green colorblindness is the most common type of colorblindness, making it not ideal for infographics. Data analysis-wise, I again feel like the lack of 'clean' tops of the bars obscures the data presentation, which would be the whole point for a data analyst. I also think a data analyst might be clearer about what each bar represents. This is probably a histogram of some kind, based on the arrow, but still, each bar is separate for a reason, and a data analyst would add labels or a legend of some kind, presumably. A layperson doing this probably lacks this knowledge or does not put in the effort to use it; they will not care to pay attention to these details because the data presentation is not as much the point as the text that assuredly would go along with this. (This is admittedly still a decent amount of effort, which is why I think the individual is passionate about the subject matter). As for right-wing vs left-wing, I feel like a lot of the people I see passionately talking about nature trends tend to be science educators, park rangers, and people who make calls to action about lawn culture and old growth forests. These categories of people are generally speaking left-wing. I also generally consider those kinds of people more altruistic than self-serving. That said, I don't actually know what this graph is for, so... I generally follow people with whom I tend to share at least some values, but that is very definitely not true across the board, and sometimes things get refuted in the reblogs, and sometimes there are fandoms involved that I'm not in, or issues I'm uninvolved or unaware of, and I just don't feel confident asserting value-sharing at this stage of the game. That said, if they're this passionate about it, and they are part of one of those aforementioned categories of people, they're probably a little trustworthy? Still have to fact check but for now let's see what they have to say. As for confrontational vs diplomatic, I don't feel like I have too much to go off there, but the fonts are fairly neutral and the colors are soft, so it's not trying too hard to grab my attention and confront me, so I'm going to assume a more diplomatic and perhaps educational vibe.","TUMBLR","4","COMPLETE","tumblr-paid","study2",13654,227.57,"Non-binary / third gender",,"White or Caucasian","undergradudate degree","Working part-time","Less than $25,000","Escape room game master","60660","25-34","Democrat",,25,40,"more-75","Administration-PersonalAssistant,CX-Customer Experience-Support",,"Tumbler,Reddit,LinkedIn,other","Discord"
