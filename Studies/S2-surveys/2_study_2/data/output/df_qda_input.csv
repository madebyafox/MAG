I included some commentary inside of my answers, but I marked it as such to not get confused with the actual answers.  (a) There were several graphs that I thought could have been the work of more than one individual. In these cases, I answered based on who I expected was acting in the supervisory capacity. It became too difficult to imagine specific gender roles for employees who may have been delegated the specific task of creating the graph. I believe that the gender question should probably have been excluded when the answer was for a corporation. Similarly, the age question had similar difficulties because this type of task could easily be delegated to an intern. But it would not be very likely that the intern could/would be credited with the creation.  (b) It was not clear about the  range between Professional and Layperson. I understand professional to be a distinction of whether an individual is paid for a task and not necessarily an indication of quality. I have known several hobby enthusiasts that I feel are of higher quality than their professional counterparts, but I did not know if Amateur/Hobbyist should be considered the halfway between professional and layperson. Because I would consider an amateur as the opposite of professional in that one gets paid and one does not. Perhaps expert would have been a better term if the intent was trained vs untrained.   (c) The time estimation seemed unrealistic for the number of questions and the level of detail requested for each response.

Therefore, I selected one generation above mine. I expect that women during this generation had fewer opportunities to interact with this type of triple-form paperwork and must therefore be more likely a male creator.

The lack of background removal in the first two images and to a lesser degree in subsequent images leads me to believe that a non-professional created this image and therefore is more likely to use a non-professional application.

The geographic map in the bottom right corner leads me to that assumption. For example, the map could be depicting the COVID-19 vaccinations of different neighboring regions. Furthermore, going off of that train of thought, the upside down bar graph may indicate the mortality rate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of what specific information this infographic is depicting, it is clearly statistics-based. This leads me to believe that a researcher collected this data and created this infographic. That means that the creator cannot be too young (Gen-Z age) nor can they be too old (retired), since most researchers are of working-age with a few years (at least) of higher-education under their belt. Although I cannot determine whether I believe this person to share my values since I am not sure what specific data they have collected, I do believe that this level of sophistication (the appearance of the graph, the inclusion of a variety of data) indicates that this person put in the time and effort to accurately reflect their findings (i.e., I can more easily trust this infographic). Because this infographic seems to be educational, I was also under the impression that the creator was likely altruistic, as those who seek the truth and attempt to educate others with such information are altruistic in their own right. The sophistication of the graph and the clear detail of the data displayed indicate to me that this creator is well-versed in data analysis and graphic design.

I also may second guess reposting this for the sole reason that it may be overwhelming to viewers.

It could also have started as a meme on how many times a character did something silly but plant-related but then the person making the image got overly committed to the bit and is now confused and perhaps a little angrily proud of the results of their efforts.",85,"millennial",55,"Female",20,80,65,37,65,30,57,65,"There are a few reasons why I think the image creator was a layperson in graphic design. The first is that the bars are not 'cleanly' shaped or consistently colored. The first bars in the 'pressed leaf' design have white behind them while the later bars have darker fronds that don't have any white behind them, and while a case could be made that that's part of what the graph is representing (some sort of leaf density?), it's not as consistent or nice looking as a professional graphic designer would make it look. Secondly, the background is a soft, very red-toned pink, and the bars are green, mostly. While red and green are complementary colors, these specific shades do not contrast particularly well (especially when I have the brightness all the way down as I usually do), and red-green colorblindness is the most common type of colorblindness, making it not ideal for infographics. Data analysis-wise, I again feel like the lack of 'clean' tops of the bars obscures the data presentation, which would be the whole point for a data analyst. I also think a data analyst might be clearer about what each bar represents. This is probably a histogram of some kind, based on the arrow, but still, each bar is separate for a reason, and a data analyst would add labels or a legend of some kind, presumably. A layperson doing this probably lacks this knowledge or does not put in the effort to use it; they will not care to pay attention to these details because the data presentation is not as much the point as the text that assuredly would go along with this. (This is admittedly still a decent amount of effort, which is why I think the individual is passionate about the subject matter). As for right-wing vs left-wing, I feel like a lot of the people I see passionately talking about nature trends tend to be science educators, park rangers, and people who make calls to action about lawn culture and old growth forests. These categories of people are generally speaking left-wing. I also generally consider those kinds of people more altruistic than self-serving. That said, I don't actually know what this graph is for, so... I generally follow people with whom I tend to share at least some values, but that is very definitely not true across the board, and sometimes things get refuted in the reblogs, and sometimes there are fandoms involved that I'm not in, or issues I'm uninvolved or unaware of, and I just don't feel confident asserting value-sharing at this stage of the game. That said, if they're this passionate about it, and they are part of one of those aforementioned categories of people, they're probably a little trustworthy? Still have to fact check but for now let's see what they have to say. As for confrontational vs diplomatic, I don't feel like I have too much to go off there, but the fonts are fairly neutral and the colors are soft, so it's not trying too hard to grab my attention and confront me, so I'm going to assume a more diplomatic and perhaps educational vibe.",33.53,"design_basic,?",55,"You can Insert graphs like this in a lot of general purpose software, though I don't really use those at all so I am unfamiliar with most of the options. That said, I think the default options have very clean bars with different outline options, so it's probably a basic photo editor maybe? I'm not sure where they got those pressed leaves, otherwise - it seems to me that they were perhaps copied from some picture (stock photo?) and then Magic Wand-ed in the later bars to erase the former white background.  Or maybe it was a brush or even a pattern fill. I couldn't say; I don't really use those options. That said, adding text is a pain in most art programs, and the levels with their accompanying numbers would be especially bothersome to make even. So...I really don't know.",47,35,50,60,"I don't usually comment on posts; it's not part of tumblr culture, for the most part. I might write something in the tags, but even then, for educational posts I just kind of let the post speak for itself. Well, I might tag it 'to fact check' if I don't have the energy to do that, but at that point I usually set the post to private or post it to my sideblog that sees much less traffic. If I don't agree with it or don't care about it I just ignore it. If a person is inundating me with a topic I don't care about I might filter out a keyword, but it usually doesn't get to that point for me. I only block the source if the source says something strongly against my values. I rarely need to unfollow; I spend a lot of time on someone's blog before I decide to follow them, so I know I like at least some of what they post. I'd rather just filter out what I don't like than cut myself off from their stuff entirely if they're into some fandom I'm not or whatever.

(This might be me being bad with geography and spatial reasoning, but the scale seems kind of off? Which decreased my graphic design score and sense of trustworthiness. But anyway). According to this, some parts near the equator get nearly as hot as human body temperature, and some parts near 50 degrees south of the equator get nearly to freezing. Anyway, this is the sort of information that would get brought up in an article about global warming, or other ecological news. The colors and key make it easy to understand, the alternating black and white make sections easy to parse, and almost everything is labeled.

Not only are the plants a detailed texture that does not lend well to a bar graph format, but the x axis seems to be some sort of gradual scale that is not usually used with a bar graph format. Software that is meant for data visualization will usually not go for this sort of format of displaying the data. Both bar graphs and histograms don't use a sliding scale with no markings on the x axis other than the extremes, so that combined with the graphics used makes me think this is someone designing the graph in some kind of graphic design software.
