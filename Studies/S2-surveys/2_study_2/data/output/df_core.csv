"2","R_7RMz3qVOtamxtE5","B3-3","MAKER_EXPLAIN","I don't recognize the flags but using them seems very nationalistic and confrontational. Also the red in the title looks dramatic and confrontational. I would think it could be something fun like sports scores the be background makes me think it's something serious. The graphic looks amateurish so I am already doubting my choice that it was done by a news organization. The data presented are simple, so maybe not a data analysis person. I picked male because the flags make me think it's some nationalistic angry person and I usually associate that with men. Also, it looks like the work of someone who wanted to get the project done and didn't care to make it look nice, which I also associate with men.","PROLIFIC","3","COMPLETE","general-prolific","study2",3236,53.93,"Female",,"Asian","graduate or professional degree","Working full-time","$100,000-$149,999","Professor","11220","45-54","Democrat",,0,0,"more-75","Data-Analysis,Education-Professional,Research",,"Twitter,Instagram,Reddit,LinkedIn",
"3","R_7NxKiY3Ujxd6zyi","B4-1","MAKER_EXPLAIN","Here, again, color palettes and fonts don't really tell me much about a person's gender or psychological profile, except in this one I would give a bit higher of a trust score given that this out of context appears professional - it has labeled axes that seem to make sense, and are laid out well - there are some things that I think only make sense with context such as why there is a 2x2 column split in the a and b labeled graphs and assuming the top 2 are a and the bottom 2 are b because there are no other labels present but again without context I'm not sure if that is a misstep or poignantly proper.","PROLIFIC","4","COMPLETE","general-prolific","study2",2707,45.12,"Male",,"White or Caucasian","graduate or professional degree","Working full-time","$50,000-$74,999","Solutions Engineer","18201","35-44","Independent",,0,50,"more-75","Engineering",,"Facebook,Youtube,Reddit,LinkedIn",

I'd need more information to have any concrete judgements but the color choice doesn't seem professional (although it's very intriguing and quite creative) it seems that there is a relationship that exists with the data leaning dominantly with high scores to the right but I would also need to know the sampling method.

"5","R_7eQCVyqCQLClabK","B1-3","MAKER_EXPLAIN","There is a slew of red flags about this graph:  Firstly, the levels or lines appear nearly identical, and there appears to only be one variable on the y-axis, meaning that these could be near-identical metrics, inflamed to appear worse than they are by adding unseen variables to the equation.  Secondly, there is a massive, ""tainted"" looking American flag in the background.  Black or ""tainted"" looking American flags with faded stars and stripes, differently colored stripes (such as those with only blue for law enforcement, red for firemen, and green for healthcare workers) tend to be associated with far-right ideologies.  This is somewhat supported by the mostly black and red color scheme of the graph overall.  I think of far-right conservatives as being older, but many are younger as well.  I think of younger side (millennial, Gen X) creating graphics like this, while the older side (older Gen X, Boomers, and even the Silent Generation/Traditionalists) shares these around, along with the younger side.  Far-rightists do not side with my values at all.  They tend to be exclusionary of people like myself in their image of what America should look like, and they are often against America's core values, those written in the Constitution and its Amendments (freedom of expression, equality, etc.) without even knowing they're against the core values.","TUMBLR","1","COMPLETE","tumblr-paid","study2",7362,122.7,"Prefer to self-describe","Transgender male","White or Caucasian","undergradudate degree","Working full-time","$100,000-$149,999","Human Resources Specialist (Classification)","92040","18-24","Other","Green",5,30,"more-75","Administration-PersonalAssistant,Human-Resources",,"Tumbler,Reddit,LinkedIn,Pinterest",
"6","R_8GBUP7EppZryxHP","B4-3","MAKER_EXPLAIN","Well, looking at it a bit more, I'm pretty sure I can tell most of what this graph is. I'm not sure what the triangles and circles mean, but I understand longitude and latitude and sea surface temperature, so this is supposed to be showing the map of sea surface temperature somewhere near like South America. (This might be me being bad with geography and spatial reasoning, but the scale seems kind of off? Which decreased my graphic design score and sense of trustworthiness. But anyway). According to this, some parts near the equator get nearly as hot as human body temperature, and some parts near 50 degrees south of the equator get nearly to freezing. Anyway, this is the sort of information that would get brought up in an article about global warming, or other ecological news. The colors and key make it easy to understand, the alternating black and white make sections easy to parse, and almost everything is labeled. No title, but that's to be expected in a news story figure. Academic textbooks don't usually have so much color, but they either have a title or have a caption calling it 'Figure B' or some such.  So, I think the figure is well made and easy to understand, generally. (Still curious about those shapes, and, as mentioned, maybe the scale or angle is off?). That said, the information presented is so neutral about it that I am unsure of how the information is being presented. For example, this could be a climate change denier, which is typically a right-wing position. On the other hand, it could be someone talking about, I don't know, marine migration patterns in the pelagic zone and how SST affects them.  Why is this official-looking color map on my dash instead of the article being linked? Suspicious. But the image itself is neutral enough that the information being presented is probably accurate.","TUMBLR","4","COMPLETE","tumblr-paid","study2",13654,227.57,"Non-binary / third gender",,"White or Caucasian","undergradudate degree","Working part-time","Less than $25,000","Escape room game master","60660","25-34","Democrat",,25,40,"more-75","Administration-PersonalAssistant,CX-Customer Experience-Support",,"Tumbler,Reddit,LinkedIn,other","Discord"
