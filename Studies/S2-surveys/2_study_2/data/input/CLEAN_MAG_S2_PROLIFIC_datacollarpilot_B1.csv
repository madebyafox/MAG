The designer spent way too much time cutting out all the leaves and didn't even fully cut them all out as there is still white background appearing in a lot off the leaf images.   It appears like the creator of the graph wanted to do a leaf themed bar graph. They all seem arbritrarily placed. I think the the bars could have just been basic shapes.
