I make graphs. I think also the pink is close enough to ""Millenial"" pink and the aesthetic seems slightly dated, like it was made by someone in her early 30's who buys t-shirts that might not say ""Girl Boss"" but do have bad puns on them?  Female, 90% confident: It's pink and green and has flowers on it. I don't like that this seems overtly feminine as a graph, but it does.  Layperson, 60%: it has Canva vibes.

Also, red-green colorblindness exists. Professional in data analysis, 3%: The lines at the top of the graph aren't clear. What self respecting data professional would do that? Also, again: colorblindness. Left wing, 25%: it feels more democrat because of the florals and because it feels like a graph about ecology or feminine issues, but I can easily imagine conservative women making something like this too.

But also: I'm sure there could be similarly pretty data presentation THAT WAS CLEARLY AT ONE PART OF THE LINE AND NOT AT ANGLES.

This could mean pretty much any political leaning.  Left ideology is more associated with higher gun control, but right ideology is associated with being tough on crime.

It could also have started as a meme on how many times a character did something silly but plant-related but then the person making the image got overly committed to the bit and is now confused and perhaps a little angrily proud of the results of their efforts.",85,millennial,55,Female,20,80,65,37,65,30,57,65,"There are a few reasons why I think the image creator was a layperson in graphic design. The first is that the bars are not 'cleanly' shaped or consistently colored. The first bars in the 'pressed leaf' design have white behind them while the later bars have darker fronds that don't have any white behind them, and while a case could be made that that's part of what the graph is representing (some sort of leaf density?), it's not as consistent or nice looking as a professional graphic designer would make it look. Secondly, the background is a soft, very red-toned pink, and the bars are green, mostly. While red and green are complementary colors, these specific shades do not contrast particularly well (especially when I have the brightness all the way down as I usually do), and red-green colorblindness is the most common type of colorblindness, making it not ideal for infographics. Data analysis-wise, I again feel like the lack of 'clean' tops of the bars obscures the data presentation, which would be the whole point for a data analyst. I also think a data analyst might be clearer about what each bar represents. This is probably a histogram of some kind, based on the arrow, but still, each bar is separate for a reason, and a data analyst would add labels or a legend of some kind, presumably. A layperson doing this probably lacks this knowledge or does not put in the effort to use it; they will not care to pay attention to these details because the data presentation is not as much the point as the text that assuredly would go along with this. (This is admittedly still a decent amount of effort, which is why I think the individual is passionate about the subject matter). As for right-wing vs left-wing, I feel like a lot of the people I see passionately talking about nature trends tend to be science educators, park rangers, and people who make calls to action about lawn culture and old growth forests. These categories of people are generally speaking left-wing. I also generally consider those kinds of people more altruistic than self-serving. That said, I don't actually know what this graph is for, so... I generally follow people with whom I tend to share at least some values, but that is very definitely not true across the board, and sometimes things get refuted in the reblogs, and sometimes there are fandoms involved that I'm not in, or issues I'm uninvolved or unaware of, and I just don't feel confident asserting value-sharing at this stage of the game. That said, if they're this passionate about it, and they are part of one of those aforementioned categories of people, they're probably a little trustworthy? Still have to fact check but for now let's see what they have to say. As for confrontational vs diplomatic, I don't feel like I have too much to go off there, but the fonts are fairly neutral and the colors are soft, so it's not trying too hard to grab my attention and confront me, so I'm going to assume a more diplomatic and perhaps educational vibe.",2.503,2009.574,2011.944,96,"design_basic,?",55,"You can Insert graphs like this in a lot of general purpose software, though I don't really use those at all so I am unfamiliar with most of the options. That said, I think the default options have very clean bars with different outline options, so it's probably a basic photo editor maybe? I'm not sure where they got those pressed leaves, otherwise - it seems to me that they were perhaps copied from some picture (stock photo?) and then Magic Wand-ed in the later bars to erase the former white background.  Or maybe it was a brush or even a pattern fill. I couldn't say; I don't really use those options. That said, adding text is a pain in most art programs, and the levels with their accompanying numbers would be especially bothersome to make even. So...I really don't know.

According to this, some parts near the equator get nearly as hot as human body temperature, and some parts near 50 degrees south of the equator get nearly to freezing.

The colors and key make it easy to understand, the alternating black and white make sections easy to parse, and almost everything is labeled. No title, but that's to be expected in a news story figure. Academic textbooks don't usually have so much color, but they either have a title or have a caption calling it 'Figure B' or some such.
