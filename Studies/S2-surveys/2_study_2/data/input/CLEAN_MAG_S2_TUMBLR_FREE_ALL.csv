It's the kind of thing you would make if you wanted to make a graphic for other people to use online to support a common point or refute a common argument but I feel that a more professional designer or news outlet would have chosen something a little more plain to increase readability. Also the text color stands out. Infographics like this get passed around on fb in groups a lot where people are discussing a specific point and saved as a ""gotcha"" response. So the graphic looks like it's probably about eco causes so that's cool, but this person probably spends a lot of time arguing online. I feel like the bar graph format is super confusing though. I keep trying to figure out what it could be counting. Greenhouse emissions over time? Idk.

Age was difficult - I put Millennial, but I was torn between that and Gen Z. Partially because to me this image shows a slightly conflicting mix of knowledge of graphic design and displaying data. It's not a bad image from a graphic design standpoint, mostly because the complicated data bars would have taken time and effort. The background color is a little jarring, but not bad. The biggest problem is the complicated design of the data bars distracts somewhat from the actual data being displayed and makes it difficult to determine exactly where the data points are. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, the bar graph at least increases at consistent intervals. The gender of the creator honestly did not even cross my mind, and being asked to think about it threw me a bit. I put female pretty much just because of gender associations (I dislike this, but my immediate association with artsy leafy patterns like this is ""female"") and because I have noticed that more than half of the people on tumblr identify as female (every time a poll about user gender goes around it's always more female).
