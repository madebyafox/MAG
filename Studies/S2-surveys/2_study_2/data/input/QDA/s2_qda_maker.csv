But I do not think the individual is a seasoned designer. It does look like the individual has some sort of design background as it would some design skills to cut out individual leaves, arrange them in equal-width bars, and create an easy to read bar graph with typographic heirarchy. My first guess at gender is Female, because of pink. An unfortunate stereotype but that is where my mind went to. To have the patience to arrange all the leaves in this order, I imagine this person as someone who is detail oriented and similar to how I work as a designer. Therefore I could expect them to share my views and be someone who is competent and trustworthy enough to give a set of data and ask for a bargraphh.",,,80,design_advanced,I think it could be either Canva or Photoshop.

Which makes me lean towards trusting it. Other than that, it's not visually pleasing. It's quite ugly. The leaves making up the bars is unecessary...especially since it seems like each bar does not represent one kind of leaf. The designer spent way too much time cutting out all the leaves and didn't even fully cut them all out as there is still white background appearing in a lot off the leaf images. It appears like the creator of the graph wanted to do a leaf themed bar graph. They all seem arbritrarily placed. I think the the bars could have just been basic shapes. The leaf theme could have been in secondary design elements. Perhaps a leaf border or just accent elements. The font choice could have been more intentional as it looks like the designer opted for a default choice."

Therefore, I selected one generation above mine. I expect that women during this generation had fewer opportunities to interact with this type of triple-form paperwork and must therefore be more likely a male creator.

I see a lot of grey text on slightly lighter grey backgrounds in blogs from respectable authors of a similar age. In this case, it is a light brown text on a tan background. It seems that my generation, for all of their intent to assist those less accessible, have discarded the concepts of a minimally appropriate contrast. For gender, I have an inherent perception that a lot of the data people from my generation are either women or gays. I am not convinced that this is necessarily a professional data analyst, but at the very least it is likely someone either studying the data sciences or an individual that follows the practice in their spare time. The chart does not look randomly produced and must have been generated from a data source. Most likely via some form of automation through an API feed. This reinforces my perceptions of age because I do not expect that level of digital comfort from older hobbyists. I do not really see any kind of political bias because the east coast and upper west coast is largely ignored. I fell back to my default understanding of U.S. population as being slightly Democratic leaning and therefore slightly more likely as liberal. I refer back to my previous statements. I have no idea if this author had a specific purpose in mind with creating the chart, but I felt it was at least partially for selfish reasons in that it was done furthering their own enjoyment of messing around with data.

My confidence in javascript is mainly because I am not familiar enough with R to know what graph creation abilities are available.

With javascript, I am aware that it is capable of all the necessary functions to pull, manipulate/clean and then graph. I expect that d3 is a popular enough library that it would not be too difficult to find a template to produce this graph. The data points seem split up in small hexagons and that format seems vaguely familiar. So I expect that the design has been popularized as a graph display option. I believe that more sophisticated options like Tableau are just a candy shell for completing tasks that can be programmatically accomplished.

Even if I had an idea, I do not know if the same person who is making the graph is also coming up with the data. The question asks about backgrounds in both data analytics and graphic design and that makes me less confident. In cases where I expect a team effort, it seems nonsensical to narrow the group down to a single gender or a single age. Then I have to factor in the possible of interns and the whole process just becomes a mess to single out a single selection. And this task has now entered the ridiculous level of required effort. I am confident that I am approaching the 1,500 word mark. (*) For these reasons I have no confident of any value that my selections for the age range or gender of the creator are accurate. I have made my best guess and so I feel confident insofar as I am more confident than the other answer options that my selected ones are correct. But I do not feel confident in the overall accuracy much more than I would rate the outcome of a coin flip. (*) The image vaguely resembles something I remember seeing in a magazine at some point in my life. I believe this could imply that the individual who came up with this idea is old enough to come from the generation of individuals who worked in the magazine business during the time I grew up. This graph does not seem to represent anything I relate to modern stylings. (*) Given the age, I am more likely to believe that the individual was male. I do not necessarily believe that this graph was more likely made by a male, but I am more confident in the age estimation of the individual and I am more confident than not that males were more representative of the workforce during the era that I vaguely remember seeing this type of graph in. And so I infer that it is possible that an employee in the magazine business, if employed at an early age, could have made his way into working for a think-tank such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation in his later years and either created or had this graph created at his direction. (*) I believe this graph was created to satisfy a requirement from his employer and is therefore entirely for selfish reasons rather than selfless. (*) I have no reason to distrust an organization without knowing more specifically about their past. I expect that a company, such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation, has had some amount of scrutiny in the past. And if they were going to lie, it would not be in such an obvious and direct manner. So I feel somewhat confident in trusting the graph as a fair representation of the graph. I am not entirely convinced that the specific choice of areas to represent are necessarily those that should be suitable for direct comparison. I also do not understand why the sizes are not uniform across the graph sections. The difference in size of 75-79 does not seem the same as 65-70 for the individual section.

The first is that the bars are not 'cleanly' shaped or consistently colored. The first bars in the 'pressed leaf' design have white behind them while the later bars have darker fronds that don't have any white behind them, and while a case could be made that that's part of what the graph is representing (some sort of leaf density?), it's not as consistent or nice looking as a professional graphic designer would make it look. Secondly, the background is a soft, very red-toned pink, and the bars are green, mostly. While red and green are complementary colors, these specific shades do not contrast particularly well (especially when I have the brightness all the way down as I usually do), and red-green colorblindness is the most common type of colorblindness, making it not ideal for infographics. Data analysis-wise, I again feel like the lack of 'clean' tops of the bars obscures the data presentation, which would be the whole point for a data analyst. I also think a data analyst might be clearer about what each bar represents. This is probably a histogram of some kind, based on the arrow, but still, each bar is separate for a reason, and a data analyst would add labels or a legend of some kind, presumably. A layperson doing this probably lacks this knowledge or does not put in the effort to use it; they will not care to pay attention to these details because the data presentation is not as much the point as the text that assuredly would go along with this. (This is admittedly still a decent amount of effort, which is why I think the individual is passionate about the subject matter). As for right-wing vs left-wing, I feel like a lot of the people I see passionately talking about nature trends tend to be science educators, park rangers, and people who make calls to action about lawn culture and old growth forests.

That said, if they're this passionate about it, and they are part of one of those aforementioned categories of people, they're probably a little trustworthy? Still have to fact check but for now let's see what they have to say. As for confrontational vs diplomatic, I don't feel like I have too much to go off there, but the fonts are fairly neutral and the colors are soft, so it's not trying too hard to grab my attention and confront me, so I'm going to assume a more diplomatic and perhaps educational vibe.",,,55,"design_basic,?","You can Insert graphs like this in a lot of general purpose software, though I don't really use those at all so I am unfamiliar with most of the options.
