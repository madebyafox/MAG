(*) My answers are primarily formed from the impression that this was created by some kind corporate entity. Possibly copied from a brochure and posted onto a social media feed. It is my belief that there are more men employed by corporations in supervisory or management positions in the marketing departments. Therefore, the graph was either created by a male or at the direction of a male to a larger probability than by a female or at the direction of a female.   (*) I do not think much of this profession and I do not think much of those who are employed as such.  Assuming this is a male, I view him as a male with less than desirable personality traits. But not to the point of absurdity.   (*) Assuming that this organization has some kind of internet presence (implied through the decision to publish this document online, as inferred by my past experiences of seeing similar graphs through online brochures), I am also to assume that there is a Democratic leaning among the employees and therefore a liberal leaning of the individual. I have no reason to believe this bends the scale too highly.

I see a lot of grey text on slightly lighter grey backgrounds in blogs from respectable authors of a similar age. In this case, it is a light brown text on a tan background. It seems that my generation, for all of their intent to assist those less accessible, have discarded the concepts of a minimally appropriate contrast.   For gender, I have an inherent perception that a lot of the data people from my generation are either women or gays. I am not convinced that this is necessarily a professional data analyst, but at the very least it is likely someone either studying the data sciences or an individual that follows the practice in their spare time. The chart does not look randomly produced and must have been generated from a data source. Most likely via some form of automation through an API feed. This reinforces my perceptions of age because I do not expect that level of digital comfort from older hobbyists.   I do not really see any kind of political bias because the east coast and upper west coast is largely ignored. I fell back to my default understanding of U.S. population as being slightly Democratic leaning and therefore slightly more likely as liberal. I refer back to my previous statements.   I have no idea if this author had a specific purpose in mind with creating the chart, but I felt it was at least partially for selfish reasons in that it was done furthering their own enjoyment of messing around with data.

With javascript, I am aware that it is capable of all the necessary functions to pull, manipulate/clean and then graph. I expect that d3 is a popular enough library that it would not be too difficult to find a template to produce this graph. The data points seem split up in small hexagons and that format seems vaguely familiar. So I expect that the design has been popularized as a graph display option. I believe that more sophisticated options like Tableau are just a candy shell for completing tasks that can be programmatically accomplished.

Even if I had an idea, I do not know if the same person who is making the graph is also coming up with the data. The question asks about backgrounds in both data analytics and graphic design and that makes me less confident. In cases where I expect a team effort, it seems nonsensical to narrow the group down to a single gender or a single age. Then I have to factor in the possible of interns and the whole process just becomes a mess to single out a single selection. And this task has now entered the ridiculous level of required effort. I am confident that I am approaching the 1,500 word mark.   (*) For these reasons I have no confident of any value that my selections for the age range or gender of the creator are accurate. I have made my best guess and so I feel confident insofar as I am more confident than the other answer options that my selected ones are correct. But I do not feel confident in the overall accuracy much more than I would rate the outcome of a coin flip.   (*) The image vaguely resembles something I remember seeing in a magazine at some point in my life. I believe this could imply that the individual who came up with this idea is old enough to come from the generation of individuals who worked in the magazine business during the time I grew up. This graph does not seem to represent anything I relate to modern stylings.   (*) Given the age, I am more likely to believe that the individual was male. I do not necessarily believe that this graph was more likely made by a male, but I am more confident in the age estimation of the individual and I am more confident than not that males were more representative of the workforce during the era that I vaguely remember seeing this type of graph in. And so I infer that it is possible that an employee in the magazine business, if employed at an early age, could have made his way into working for a think-tank such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation in his later years and either created or had this graph created at his direction.   (*) I believe this graph was created to satisfy a requirement from his employer and is therefore entirely for selfish reasons rather than selfless.   (*) I have no reason to distrust an organization without knowing more specifically about their past. I expect that a company, such as RAND or The Heritage Foundation, has had some amount of scrutiny in the past. And if they were going to lie, it would not be in such an obvious and direct manner. So I feel somewhat confident in trusting the graph as a fair representation of the graph. I am not entirely convinced that the specific choice of areas to represent are necessarily those that should be suitable for direct comparison. I also do not understand why the sizes are not uniform across the graph sections. The difference in size of 75-79 does not seem the same as 65-70 for the individual section.

Not only are the plants a detailed texture that does not lend well to a bar graph format, but the x axis seems to be some sort of gradual scale that is not usually used with a bar graph format. Software that is meant for data visualization will usually not go for this sort of format of displaying the data. Both bar graphs and histograms don't use a sliding scale with no markings on the x axis other than the extremes, so that combined with the graphics used makes me think this is someone designing the graph in some kind of graphic design software.  It's hard to say exactly what software, but I do think this would be easier to achieve in something more high-end, especially considering the complexity of the plant patterns changing to presumably tell something.",30,48,92,26,"Depending on the topic and how relevant it is to me, I would likely either look at further sources, keep scrolling, or reblog with my own commentary.

I don't like to trust only one source, and I like being able to see how exactly data was gathered and used, instead of just trusting that the graph will be accurate and unbiased.

Especially looking at the numbers of the left and middle bar graphs, it's interesting to me how the leftmost graph has the highest number of $920, but is still shorter than the highest bar of the middle graph, which reaches only $206.
